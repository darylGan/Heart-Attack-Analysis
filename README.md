# Listen to Your Heart

## About this Project
Coronary Heart Disease has been the top cause of death in Malaysia for some time. We wish to develop an application that can predict the likelihood of a person to suffer from heart disease, using some indicators of it. Thus, people can detect heart diseases earlier to get immediate treatment. That is the reason we made the 'Listen to your Heart' app, we hope it will benefit our stakeholders: the general public.
