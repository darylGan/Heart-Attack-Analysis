# Listen to your Heart

## About this Project
Coronary Heart Disease has been the top cause of death in Malaysia for some time. We wish to develop an application that can predict the likelihood for a person to have heart disease using some indicators of heart disease. Thus, people can know it earlier and get early treatment. So, we came up with this 'Listen to your Heart' app that we hope it will benefits the general public.
